Which of the following reaction is used to synthesize "CETRIMONIUM BROMIDE: "trimethylalkylammonium bromide"?
D
A.
secondary amine formation

B.
benzylation

C.
quaternary amine formation

D.
acylation

E.
benzoylation
The correct answer is C. quaternary amine formation.

To prepare methylene bridge (-CH2-) in the synthetic reactions, the following is required:

A.
Formic acid

B.
Formaldehyde

C.
Benzaldehyde

D.
Benzoic acid

E.
acetaldehyde
The correct answer is B. Formaldehyde. Methylene bridges (-CH2-) can be prepared through the reaction of formaldehyde with a suitable nucleophile, such as an amine or alcohol, in the presence of an acid catalyst. This reaction is known as the "Mannich reaction" or "Mannich condensation" and is widely used in organic synthesis to introduce methylene bridges into molecules.

Ethionamide 2-(ethyl)isonicotinthioamide has the following functional groups:

A.
primary amine, amide

B.
tertiary amine, ester

C.
ring nitrogene, amide

D.
primary amine, carboxylic acid

E.
ring nitrogene, thioamide
The correct answer is E. ring nitrogen, thioamide. Ethionamide has two functional groups: an isonicotinyl ring with a nitrogen atom and a thioamide functional group. The isonicotinyl ring contains a nitrogen atom that is part of an aromatic ring, while the thioamide group consists of a carbonyl group and a sulfur atom. The ethyl group is attached to the nitrogen atom in the thioamide group. Therefore, the functional groups present in ethionamide are a ring nitrogen and a thioamide group.

Which one is a moiety for alkylating agents?

A.
Sulfone

B.
Sulfonamide

C.
Quinoline

D.
Bis-(2-chloroethyl)amine

E.
Hydrazide
The correct answer is D. Bis-(2-chloroethyl)amine. A moiety is a functional group or a distinct part of a molecule that is responsible for its chemical behavior. Alkylating agents are chemicals that add alkyl groups to nucleophilic amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Bis-(2-chloroethyl)amine is a type of alkylating agent that contains two alkylating groups (-CH2-CH2-Cl) attached to a nitrogen atom. Sulfone, sulfonamide, quinoline, and hydrazide are not moieties for alkylating agents.

Which one contain a diphenol?

A.
resorcinol

B.
chlorocresol

C.
thymol

D.
isopropanol

E.
hexachlorophene
The correct answer is A. Resorcinol. Resorcinol is a diphenol compound that contains two hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to a benzene ring. Chlorocresol, thymol, isopropanol, and hexachlorophene are not diphenols. Chlorocresol is a phenol derivative that contains a single hydroxyl group and a chlorine atom. Thymol is a monocyclic phenol that contains a hydroxyl group and a methyl group. Isopropanol is a primary alcohol that contains a hydroxyl group attached to a three-carbon chain. Hexachlorophene is a chlorinated bisphenol that contains multiple chlorine atoms and two phenolic hydroxyl groups.

Which of the following compound contain phenol and carboxylic acid functional grou

A.
5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline

B.
4-amino-3-isoxazolidine

C.
ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate

D.
pyridine-3-carboxamide

E.
o-hydroxybenzoic acid
The correct answer is E. o-hydroxybenzoic acid. o-Hydroxybenzoic acid, also known as salicylic acid, contains both a phenol and a carboxylic acid functional group. The phenol group is attached to the benzene ring, and the carboxylic acid group is attached to the adjacent carbon atom. 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline contains a phenol and an alcohol functional group, but not a carboxylic acid. 4-amino-3-isoxazolidine contains an amino and an oxazolidine functional group. Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate contains a phenol and an ester functional group. Pyridine-3-carboxamide contains a pyridine and an amide functional group, but not a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

What are the names of required functional groups in sulfonamide derivatives?

A.
Primary aromatic amine and substituted sulfonyl chloride

B.
Heterocyclic amine and substituted sulfonic acid

C.
Primary aromatic amine and substituted sulfonamide

D.
Heterocyclic amide and substituted sulfonamide

E.
Tertiary amine and substituted sulfonamide
The correct answer is C. Primary aromatic amine and substituted sulfonamide. Sulfonamide derivatives contain a sulfonamide functional group (-SO2NH2) and an aromatic primary amine functional group (-NH2) on the same molecule. The sulfonamide group is usually substituted with different substituents such as alkyl, aryl, or heterocyclic groups to modify the pharmacological properties of the molecule. Heterocyclic amine and substituted sulfonic acid, heterocyclic amide and substituted sulfonamide, tertiary amine and substituted sulfonamide, and primary aromatic amine and substituted sulfonyl chloride are not the required functional groups in sulfonamide derivatives.

Which one is a metabolite of the prodrug "Urotropine (hexamethylene tetramine)"?

A.
formaldehyde

B.
benzaldehyde

C.
acetic acid

D.
formic acid

E.
acetaldehyde

N
The correct answer is A. Formaldehyde. Urotropine, also known as hexamethylene tetramine, is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed in acidic urine to release formaldehyde and ammonia. Formaldehyde is then further oxidized to formic acid in the liver. Benzaldehyde, acetic acid, and acetaldehyde are not metabolites of urotropine. Formic acid is a metabolite of formaldehyde, not urotropine directly.

Which pathway (or order) is correct to synthesise ISONIAZID (isonicotinic acid hydrazide) starting from gama-picoline?

A.
oxidation, esterification, hydrazide addition

B.
reduction, esterification, hydrazine addition

C.
hydrolysis, esterification, hydrazine addition

D.
esterification, reduction, hydrazide addition

E.
oxidation, esterification, hydrazine addition
The correct pathway to synthesize ISONIAZID (isonicotinic acid hydrazide) starting from gamma-picoline is:

E. Oxidation, esterification, hydrazine addition.

The synthesis of Isoniazid involves the following steps:

Oxidation: Gamma-picoline is first oxidized to 2-cyanopyridine using potassium permanganate.
Esterification: 2-cyanopyridine is then esterified with propionyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine to form the corresponding propionyl derivative.
Hydrazine addition: The propionyl derivative is finally treated with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol to obtain Isoniazid, which is the hydrazide of isonicotinic acid.
Therefore, option E is the correct pathway to synthesize ISONIAZID (isonicotinic acid hydrazide) starting from gamma-picoline.

The starting compound for DIPHENOXYLATE 1-(3-cyano3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-phenyl-4-piperidinocarboxylic acid ethyl ester is Diphenylacetonitrile.

The synthesis of Diphenoxylate involves the following steps:

Condensation: Diphenylacetonitrile is condensed with ethyl chloroacetate in the presence of a base like sodium hydride to form an intermediate ester.
Hydrolysis: The intermediate ester is then hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide to form the corresponding acid.
Reduction: The acid is then reduced with sodium borohydride to form the alcohol.
Amidation: The alcohol is finally treated with 3-cyano-3,3-diphenylpropylamine to obtain Diphenoxylate.
Therefore, the correct answer is B. Diphenylacetonitrile is the starting compound for DIPHENOXYLATE 1-(3-cyano3,3-diphenylpropyl)-4-phenyl-4-piperidinocarboxylic acid ethyl ester.
